### General Assembly - Software Engineering Immersive Project 3: HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, Javascript, Node.js, React.js, MongoDB, Mongoose

# Introduction
Have you ever needed to know what the weather is like at the origin and destination of your route? You have come to the right place. Use Raincheck to save your trips and check the weather at the start and end of each trip. Based on that you'll be able to determine what mode of travel is best or what you might need to wear to take on the day. 

## Project Requirements
This is the third of four projects that will be incorporated as part of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive. The goal is to combined all that we have learned in Units 1, 2, and 3 (HTML, CSS, Javasript, Node.js, Express.js, React.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Authentication) into a full-stack web application that we can publish for the public. This project requires us to work in a team of three or four developers which also allows us to employ... 



## Technical Requirements
The technical requirements of this project are as follows:
* Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end
* Note that if you build an app using Ionic, a backend is optional. However, look into services such as      Firebase if you'd like a service for storing data.
* Have an interactive front-end, preferably using a modern front-end framework
* Be a complete product, which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple models. However, this is ultimately up to your discretion.
* Use a database, whether that's one we've covered in class or one you want to learn
* Implement thoughtful user stories that are significant enough to help you know which features to build and which to scrap
* Have a visually impressive design to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers
* Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible



# NPM and APIs

Run npm install to install all of the dependencies


## Pulling from APIs

This project combines three APIs with an option to incorporate additional ones: 
1. Dark Sky API - https://darksky.net/dev/docs#overview
2. Mapbox API - https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/

Images of the API sites

### Mapbox API:

## The Following was provided by the node module create-react-app. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
